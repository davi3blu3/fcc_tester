# Simple Mocha testing environment in Node

## PreRequisites

You will need to have node.js and npm installed on your computer to use this repo.  Get started here:

* For Mac:
    * http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac
    * You will be following the installation steps in Terminal.

* For Windows:
    * http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows
    * If you are on a Windows machine then I suggest using [GitBash](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads) as your command prompt/terminal instead of [powershell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell). It will allow you to use common [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) commands _(although some do not work)_ and use Git commands.

## Installation

### 1. Download or clone the repository. Navigate to the directory you want to install to, and type the following command.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davi3blu3/fcc_tester.git
```

### 2. Install the Dev Dependency modules.

```
npm install
```

Now you're ready to test!

## Testing

### 1. Type the following command to access the testing folder.

```
cd tests
```

### 2. Run an example tests by typing following command.

```
mocha findLongestWord_test.js
```

### 3. Now try writing your own tests!  I recommend this excellent tutorial if you're new to mocha: http://jrsinclair.com/articles/2016/gentle-introduction-to-javascript-tdd-intro/
